# AirBnB_clone Project

Welcome to the AirBnB clone project!

## Project Description: Overview, purpose and objectives.

The AirBnB clone project aims to develop a command-line interface that mimics the functionality of the AirBnB platform. This command interpreter allows users to manage AirBnB objects such as

- Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)
- Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc…
- Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…)
- Update attributes of an object
- Destroy an object

## Command Interpreter Description:

### How to Start: how to start the command interpreter.

To start the command interpreter, run the `console.py` script.

### How to Use: how users can interact with it, including available commands and their usage.

Once the command interpreter is running, you will see a prompt `(hbnb)`. You can then enter commands to perform various tasks such as creating, viewing, updating, and deleting AirBnB objects.

### Examples: examples of using the command interpreter for common tasks.

- To create a new user:
